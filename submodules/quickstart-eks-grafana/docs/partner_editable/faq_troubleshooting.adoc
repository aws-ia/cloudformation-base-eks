*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, we recommend that you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. (This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options* page.) With this setting, the stackâ€™s state is retained, and the workload remains running so you can troubleshoot the issue.

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for the stack. Make sure to delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.
