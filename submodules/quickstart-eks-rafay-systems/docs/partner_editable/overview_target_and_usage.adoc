This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Rafay’s Kubernetes Operations Platform (KOP) for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) management and operations. With KOP, your platform and site-reliability engineering (SRE) teams can deploy, operate, and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications in both AWS Cloud and on-premises environments.

With the Rafay Kubernetes Operations Platform, enterprises use a single operations platform to manage the lifecycle of Amazon EKS clusters and containerized applications. With KOP, your platform and site-reliability engineering (SRE) teams can speed up the deployment of new applications to production, reduce application downtimes, and reduce security and compliance risks associated with their infrastructure.

This Quick Start is for platform and SRE professionals who want to deploy and manage the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters and modern applications in the AWS Cloud, in data centers, and at network edges. Rafay’s SaaS-based platform can automate multicluster provisioning, configuration management, and upgrades for Kubernetes clusters through an automation-ready command line interface (CLI), a Terraform provider, a standards-based API, and an easy-to-use web-based console.

Rafay automates the deployment of containerized applications and enables access to Kubernetes clusters through a zero-trust connectivity model. A unified dashboard provides enterprise-grade capabilities, such as monitoring and visibility across AWS Regions, role-based access control, and governance.

=== KOP on AWS

KOP manages the complete lifecycle of native Kubernetes services. You can programmatically (or via the KOP console) create and configure EKS clusters and core infrastructure components, such as computation, storage, and networking. For high-availability clusters, KOP automatically provisions worker nodes across three Availability Zones.

This approach is agnostic to the type and provider of the underlying infrastructure and is designed to work with bare-metal servers and virtual machines. When pre-existing clusters are provisioned or imported into KOP, KOP provides a source of visibility and lifecycle management for applications and clusters across environments. The benefits of this include the following:

* *One console across AWS Regions and on-premises:* Use a single console to deploy, view, and manage clusters and workloads across clusters.
* *Apply enterprise-grade K8 security on AWS:* Rafay’s zero-trust architecture for Kubernetes lets enterprises conceal Kubernetes API endpoints on AWS without affecting continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) and developer workflows.
* *Multicluster application deployment across environments:* Rafay’s zero-trust architecture for Kubernetes lets enterprises deploy containerized applications using existing CI/CD systems or via Rafay’s GitOps feature set.
