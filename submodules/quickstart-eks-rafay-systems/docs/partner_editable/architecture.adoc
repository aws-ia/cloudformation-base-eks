Deploying this Quick Start with default parameters into an existing Amazon EKS cluster builds the following environment. For a diagram of the new virtual private cloud (VPC) and Amazon EKS cluster, see the https://prod-us-west-2.aem-author.marketing.aws.a2z.com/content/aws.amazon.com/staging/en_US/quickstart/architecture/amazon-eks.html[Modular and Scalable Amazon EKS Architecture^] Quick Start.

//image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[width=100%,height=100%]

//As shown in <<architecture>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon EC2 instances in the private subnets. To manage the cluster, the bastion hosts are configured with the Kubernetes `Kubectl` command line interface.
* In the private subnets, Kubernetes worker nodes that automatically set up the Rafay Operator software, which connects to the Rafay Kubernetes Operations Platform.
* Amazon EKS, which creates the Kubernetes control plane.



// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
